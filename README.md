 
#### PROJECT’S SPECIFICATION  


##### In current project I built backtesting program in order to compare 3 trading strategies.
*	Moving average crossover
*	Filtering strategy
*	Stochastic oscilator

##### There were written 4 scripts:
*	Strategy2.py
*	Optimization.py
*	Plot.py
*	Main.py

##### In Strategy2.py  I  developed  “strategy” class which contains all current and future trading strategies  as methods.
##### In Optimizaton.py contains optimization function through which one can optimize Moving Average and Filtering strategies
##### In file Plot.py one find a “plot” class through which he can get visual representation of the strategies
##### Main.py contains script of  final results.
##### In order to get full comprehension of the current project, I have created Jupyter Notebook file where I  showed main results of the work .
